The CAN project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - CAN controller speed: 500 kbits
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message 
 - display received and transmitted byte values on LCD display

This example shows how to use CAN peripheral and how to 
simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer


The CAN example is available in different targets:

  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash
                   (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM
                   (used for target debugging)

Notes:      
  - to use this example on real CAN network remove 
    CAN_testmode line from CanDemo.c file
